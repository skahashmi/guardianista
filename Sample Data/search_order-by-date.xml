        <body> &quot;Harry Redknapp has recently been bleating on about Tottenham&apos;s fixture congestion ? they play six matches in 17 days, including one in the Ukraine and one a cup final at Wembley,&quot; asked Tommy Dark last week. &quot;But what manager has had the most congestion to worry about ? Roy Hodgson and Trevor Francis excluded?&quot;  Like nostalgia, congestion ain&apos;t what it used to be. Back in the days a combination of multiple FA Cup replays and regularish postponements often led to huge clumps of fixtures at the end of the season. That&apos;s pretty rare these days but there was, as David Stevenson points out, a right old pile-up for Rangers at the back end of the last season: because of their success on four fronts, they had to play nine games in 24 days between 1 and 24 May, and ended up losing the Uefa Cup final to Zenit St Petersburg and the title race to Celtic.  Manchester United also suffered fixture congestion in two title races in the 90s. In the penultimate week of the 1991-92 season they played four games in eight days, from which they took only one point as Leeds United overtook them on the final lap; they had the same schedule in the final week of the 1996-97 season, but won the title despite drawing the first three of those games.  Congestion can also come in bitesize form. &quot;Every Easter in the early 1960s there were three full days of league football over the four days,&quot; notes John Chapman. &quot;In 1961 Arsenal were at Fulham on Good Friday, at Bolton the following day and at home to Fulham on Easter Monday, all for a maximum of 20 quid a week. I don&apos;t recall anyone moaning about fixture congestion then.&quot;  Or, especially, in the days when penalties were not used to decide FA Cup ties, which could go on longer than a series of Lost. In 1980, when the FA Cup semi-final between Arsenal and Liverpool famously went to a third replay, the Gunners played 12 games in 31 days between 5 April and 5 May, a run that took in the Cup Winners&apos; Cup semi-final against Juventus as well. And between 12 April and 3 May, they played eight games in 21 days - all away from home.  Arsenal won both semi-finals, but then lost the finals to West Ham and Valencia respectively.  Arsenal had a not dissimilar squash at the end of the 1992-93 season, in which they and Sheffield Wednesday contested both domestic cup finals. &quot;Funnily enough, when Trevor Francis was in charge at Sheffield Wednesday the Owls suffered major fixture congestion,&quot; pipes up Peter Gethin. &quot;Between 1 and 15 May Wednesday played six matches including a Wembley final. That bloody replay [in which Arsenal won the FA Cup final through a last-minute goal from Andy Linighan] was played five days later on Thursday 20 May.&quot;  Know of any more fixture pile-ups? If so, you know who to email. THE GREATEST PLUG OUTSIDE OF THE BEANO Available now, The Knowledge in book form, a collection of our favourite questions and answers from the past nine years.    LIES, DAMN LIES, ETC   &quot;I&apos;m yet to be impressed by Edwin van der Sar&apos;s clean-sheet performance,&quot; writes a hard-to-please Ben Andrew. &quot;Having all those clean sheets is all very well and good, but how many saves did he make in that period? While maintaining a continuous clean sheet what would his saves-to minutes played ratio be? Which goalkeeper would have the best record when analysed so?&quot;  For this sort of query, Ben, we turn to our friends at Opta. They tell us that in the 14 games in which Van der Sar has kept clean sheets, he has saved nine shots from inside the box and 13 shots from outside the box, for a grand total of 22 saves. West Brom&apos;s Scott Carson can expect to be almost as busy during any given first half.  As for your other query, all the stats can be seen in our table below:  What can we draw from it? That Van der Sar has a shot to deal with every 37 minutes or so ? less than three a game ? but also that his save ratio is the best of any regular Premier League keeper. Carson, on the other hand, has to make saves every 15 minutes and he&apos;s succesful 69% of the time. Ross Turnbull and Jussi Jaaskelainen do rather well out of it, ranking quite highly both in terms of save percentage and workload. England&apos;s David James and Paul Robinson, meanwhile, look to be having rather poor seasons. But, lies, damn lies and all that ... THE STRANGEST CUP KIT EVER? &quot;I read a report recently in some footie trivia compendium that claimed a Blackburn Olympic side had to play an FA Cup final in the late 1880s in white tailored dress shirts, due to a clash of colours with the opposition,&quot; writes an astounded Daryl Vodden. &quot;Is this madness really true, and is this the most ludicrous &apos;kit&apos; to ever grace the Cup final?&quot;  Unfortunately, Daryl, it&apos;s not true. It was in fact Blackburn Rovers who were forced to play in white dress shirts against Sheffield Wednesday, and it occured in 1890. Rovers arrived in south London (the final was to be held at the Kennington Oval) only to find that Wednesday were also intending to play in blue and white shirts. This problem was solved by a quick trip to a London tailor, who provided Blackburn with nice, neat white dress shirts. They didn&apos;t seem to hinder the Lancastrian side, with Rovers winning this particular war of the roses 6-1.  As for whether it&apos;s the most ludicrous kit ever worn in a cup final, we think it probably is. If you disagree, feel free to get in touch at the usual address. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Where is the most unusual place a match ball has been lost during a game (eg river, road)?&quot; wondered Matthew Crocker way back when all this were fields. Well, 18 months ago.  You might think a river an unusual place to lose a ball, Matthew, but in some parts of the world nothing could be more natural. Take Shrewsbury, for example, where the local club&apos;s former home at Gay Meadow was situated right on the banks of the River Severn. They used to lose so many balls to the river that they even employed a local coracle maker - Fred Davies - to sit in one of his boats during matches and retrieve any that wound up in the water.  But rivers are small fry - try playing right next to the sea like Welsh outfit Holyhead Town. &quot;I remember in the late 50s or 60s reading a short report of a match at Holyhead Town having to be abandoned because all the balls had been kicked out to sea,&quot; offers Paul Crankshaw.  What Paul can&apos;t tell us, however, is whether those balls were lost intentionally, as a number apparently were during the 1941 Rio State Championship final between Fluminense and Flamengo. &quot;Fluminense only needed a draw and went 2-0 up, but then Flamengo got level in the 83rd minute,&quot; explains Guilherme Tanaka. &quot;Fluminense&apos;s players then took to hoofing balls into a nearby lake until they had run out altogether. The ruse nearly backfired as Flamengo&apos;s directors sent their rowing team to retrieve the balls, and a considerable amount of time was added on, but in the end Flamengo couldn&apos;t find another goal and Fluminense retained the title.&quot;  You don&apos;t need water to lose a football though, as Paul Kilgour discovered at a pre-season friendly between Cardiff and Danish first division outfit Frem in Copenhagen. &quot;At one point the ball was hoofed up the pitch and over the goal,&quot; recalls a misty-eyed Paul. &quot;The ball boy gave chase, but a dog got there first and chased the ball into the woods, never to be seen again.&quot; Ah, the memories.  For Tom Oxley, however, the strangest place a ball could possibly end up is ... York. His position becomes a bit more understandable when you realise the game was taking place in Kent. &quot;On a York City away day to Gravesend (now Ebbsfleet United) we arrived five minutes late for kick-off, and as we were running across the car park a ball came flying out of the stadium,&quot; says Tom. &quot;I managed to hide it under a traffic cone, collecting it after the game and taking it home, where it soon became the official match ball for the York City FC supporters&apos; club, until someone blasted it on to the roof of Oaklands School, never to be retrieved. A twice lost ball, 250 miles from home.&quot;  For more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive. Can you help? &quot;Melbourne Victory beat Adelaide United on 28 February 28 to win the A-League title,&quot; begins David Stockman. &quot;The 1-0 win was the sixth time Melbourne had beaten Adelaide in the season. Has any other title-winning team beaten a rival on more occasions in a single season?&quot;  &quot;Man U&apos;s starting XI for their first-leg Champions League match against Inter icontained players from each of the five international sides in Ireland and Britain. When was the last time all five were represented on one side in a European Cup or Champions League knockout match?&quot; ponders Michael Faherty.  &quot;Howard Wilkinson was the last English manager to win the Premier League (or old First Division) title in 1992. That&apos;s 17 years ago, and looks likely to continue for a good while longer,&quot; writes Chris McDonald. &quot;Is this the longest spell for any country&apos;s top league not to be won by a manager from that country?&quot;  Send your questions and answers to knowledge@guardian.co.uk. </body>

      <type-specific class="article">
        <body> The NHS is failing to deal adequately with complaints about its services, according to a recent report by the Healthcare Commission, the watchdog responsible for reviewing complaints that cannot be resolved at a local NHS trust level. The report reveals that the proportion of complaints upheld rose last year by 50%  - and in less than a fifth of the 9,000 cases it looked at, the watchdog sided with the trust.  Most worrying for those who believe in the importance of listening to user feedback as a means of improving services, the main issue raised by complainants was the way in which the NHS handles complaints. In other words, what bugs people most is not the issue that led them to complain, but the way in which the NHS responded when they did so. Complaints, it appears, breed complaints about complaints.  What the figures cannot show is how many people wanted to complain but failed to do so because they believed there wasn&apos;t any point. It&apos;s only a hunch, but I&apos;d hazard a guess that users of psychiatric services are not exactly under-represented in this category. It&apos;s not that we don&apos;t moan. The psychiatric service user without at least one burgeoning grievance is a very rare being indeed. But while moaning is the province of the disempowered, a complaint requires at the very least a hope that one might be heard.  A complaint is more than a moan; it is a call to action. The action called for may range from a simple apology to compensation to a full-scale inquiry and reform of the service in question, but whatever the specifics, the complainant wants something back. And the more they have to barter with, the more likely they are to get it. Regrettably, the success of complaints has more to do with the power of the complainant than with the merits of their particular case, as anyone who has tried complaining about social security benefits, for example, can readily attest. And few positions, if indeed any, can be quite as powerless when it comes to complaining as that of the mental health patient.  A typical letter of commercial complaint comprises the following elements, the proportions of which may vary: a compliment designed to flatter the reader and impress on them the sound judgment of the complainant, along the lines of: &quot;I&apos;ve been a loyal customer for the last 10 years and have always been tremendously impressed both by your products and your exceptional standards of service&quot;; an expression of shock at being let down, culminating in &quot;I was therefore extremely disappointed...&quot;; empathy with the predicament of those responsible for the failure, such as &quot;Naturally, I understand that a car is a complicated piece of equipment...&quot;; or a request for some form of restitution and a threat of forever withdrawing custom if this is not forthcoming.  With this model in mind, it&apos;s not hard to see why psychiatric service users may struggle to get their complaints taken seriously. The fact that they have mental health problems automatically calls into question the soundness of their judgment why else are they barred from jury service? And the longevity and loyalty of their custom, far from aiding their cause, is likely to be held against them. Any shock or anger at the way they have been treated is easily dismissed as a symptom of their condition, and a threat of withdrawing custom can always be answered with a section.  The complaints of psychiatric patients are, in short, so instantly dismissible that they are seldom worth making at all. Time and again, it proves too tempting for recipients of service users complaints to exploit the credibility gap, rather than confronting the awkward process of self-examination.  There are, of course, complaints procedures for mental health services, like anything else, but unless we are prepared to address the stigma that lies at the heart of the problem, these are likely to constitute little more than box-ticking cosmetics. Which is a shame, as the genuine feedback of service users, both positive and negative, might be seen as something well worth bartering for.  ? Clare Allan is a writer and author. </body>
