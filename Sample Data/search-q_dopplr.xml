        <body> Travel-tracking social network Dopplr has nearly outdone itself in the end-of-year-personal-charts department by coming up with this beast called a &apos;Personal Annual Report&apos;.   Obama&apos;s year, as seen by Dopplr. Photograph: Dopplr.com/Flickr/Some rights reserved  It&apos;s a PDF-format summary of all you Dopplr activity for the year, with visualisations and travel stats, photos, travel schedule and your carbon-polluting data. As a nice touch, you don&apos;t even need to do anything to get your hands on one of these; every Dopplr user will receive one automatically in the next week.  Dopplr has churned out Barack Obama&apos;s personal report for the year as an example, and that&apos;s far more impressive than most of us mere mortals. Obama took 234 trips in 2008, according to publicly available data from the US.  He spent:  • 133 days at home, and 233 days travelling  • He spent the most time in his (now former) hometown of Chicago  • Travelled 337,729km - or 92% of the distance to the moon  • And he produced 42,299kg of CO2 - equivalent to 4.2 Hummers being run for one year.    Ooops - a bit of a Hum-dinger. Photograph: Dopplr.com/Flickr/Some rights reserved  &quot;As a man with strong views on climate-change, the environment and energy, the President-Elect will no doubt be very interested in the carbon estimate of his travels during the campaign as calculated by AMEE,&quot; writes Matt Jones on the Dopplr blog today.  &quot;We&apos;ve deliberately chosen a provocative visualisation here - a scale of the equivalent CO2 yearly output of Hummer SUVs to convey the estimate in concrete terms. Many of us after all would think very hard about driving such a vehicle, perhaps harder than we do about taking a flight.&quot;   </body>

        <body> Another victory for Silicon Roundabout: The travel social network Dopplr just announced funding with list of backers that reads like a who&apos;s who of the tech world. Could this be the most star-studded investment announcement to date?  Rather boringly, Dopplr aren&apos;t saying how much this latest round has raised, but said the investment will be used for expanding the service outside Europe.  And those investors include: Esther Dyson, Thomas Glocer, Joshua Schachter, Azemn Azhar, Yat Siu, Aditya dev Sood, Lars Hinrichs, Brian Behlendorf, Daniel Sachs, Joshua Cooper Ramo and Kim Weckström. Investors in the first round included Reid Hoffman, Joichi Ito and Martin Varsavsky - and Saul Klein invested in both.  If LinkedIn has nailed the corporate in-the-office thing, Dopplr has nailed the aspirational out-of-office traveller. The partnership potential is huge here; the partnership with lifestyle title Monocle (Tyler Brûlé is another backer) give Dopplr scope to, according to Brûlé, &quot;improve the travel experience for all by engaging in discussions with not only our members but also travel brands and government agencies seeking informed opinions&quot;.  Dopplr users span 160 countries and average 10 trips each per year, so this is high-end userbase. The top five destinations are London, New York, San Francisco, Paris and Berlin so no big surprises there.  My aggravation has been that I tend to go to more obscure places, and Dopplr doesn&apos;t &apos;learn&apos; - or won&apos;t listen. That said, I complained that Lundy wasn&apos;t listed (I wasn&apos;t looking for the one in Haiti) and they added it, so perhaps they do listen after all. Perhaps it could start suggesting where I might like to go, based on my history. I&apos;ve got two weeks&apos; holiday in October... </body>

        <body> Founded: 2007 Staff: 5 Backing: Undisclosed private investment  It started as a tool for a small number of friends who spent a lot of time on the road, but now Dopplr is billing itself as a full social networking site for frequent travellers.  The service lets you keep track of your friends and colleagues and find out where they will be and when – perfect for international jet setters and people who spend a lot of time on the road. Still nascent (it&apos;s currently in an invitiation-only beta trial) Dopplr&apos;s creators have a lot of plans in mind: hooking in to travel websites, carbon offsetting programmes and white labelling could all be on the cards.  Although the brainchild of Finnish designer Marko Ahtisaari (who now works for another startup, mobile advertising network Blyk) the site has strong British credentials, with former BBC web wunderkinds Matt Jones and Matt Biddulph also among the founders.   The team are aware that they are in danger of being crushed by larger sites – and so are happy to push Dopplr&apos;s systems out into other heavyweight services like Facebook – but with travel and social networking two of the web&apos;s hottest and most profitable properties, investors may soon be scrabbling to get a piece of the action.

        <body>  Posr: Matt Jones and Matt Biddulph. Photograph: Sarah Lee/Guardian  A few weeks ago when we published a list of 10 indie dotcoms to watch, I thought we&apos;d have to wait a while before we had news on any developments. In fact, we didn&apos;t have to hang on for long.  Last week Extate.com, the property search engine, announced that it had received a round of financing from The Accelerator Group (run by former Guardian columnist Saul Klein), Arts Alliance and Samos Investments. It&apos;s not immense amounts of cash, I&apos;m told, but enough for the company to continuing growing and spreading its wings.  Then today Dopplr, a networking system for frequent travellers, said it too had received early-stage financing - again from The Accelerator Group, but also from a group of individuals including Martin Varsavsky (Fon), Joi Ito and Reid Hoffman (formerly of PayPal).  Varsavsky gives his reasons for investing in the release:    &quot;We chose to invest in Dopplr because of the strong team and the simple execution of a great idea. Dopplr is like the iPod of social networks. It is very valuable to know where your friends and colleagues will be and where in the world you will meet them next. This is the one thing that Dopplr does really well.&quot;    (Incidentally, I&apos;m hoping that other people will carry on the Dopplr photo meme which Sarah Lee&apos;s portraits have started) </body>

        <body> It&apos;s crunch time at Social Innovation Camp, where the seven teams are about to present their projects so far. Teams were kicked out of their base at the Young Foundation at 11pm last night and were back at 8.20 to hammer out their prototypes, said SICamp co-founder Paul Miller. The three criteria will be the extent to which the project really can power social change, whether the technology used goes beyond early adopters into something accessible for the mainstream, and &apos;proof of change&apos; - how this project really can bring about social change. Judges are Deborah Szebeko of Thinkpublic, Lee Bryant from Headshift, Umair Haque from Havas Media Lab, Matt Biddulph from Dopplr and Geoff Mulder from the Young Foundation.  AccessCity  How close do they get to their goal of enabling trouble-free travel? The team focused on London first and knocked up the first incarnation of the site at accesscity.co.uk. Users can send in videos, photos or texts of problems at their local stop; Bethnal Green has no lift, for example, and steep steps.  The tech team started by building an API and also knocked up an iPhone app version, and the whole idea could be extended to link up with initiatives including OpenStreetMap and SitOrSquat and potentially expanded to puJK Web 2.0 Dec 2008.rtf blic toilets, shops, museums ad restaurants. It all fits with Boris Johnson&apos;s pledge to make London the most accessible city ever to host an Olympics, so perhaps it will even be adopted by Transport for London as a formal solution for access information.  AccessCity.co.uk  Carbon Co-op  Carbon Co-op will act as a trusted guide to all the issues around energy saving, enabling more people to save more money and save more carbon by clubbing together for discounted services and products. The team used SICamp to prove that there is demand and a market for this service and think that they can piggy back on the networks of supporters, through Facebook etc, and work with existing projects like Transition Towns and the Manchester Sustainability Initiative.  The project will make money either by taking a small percentage of the deals they broker, or attract investment from the government and investments in alternative technologies. But it&apos;s a not-for-profit model, so all the funds, after costs are paid and investors reimbursed, go back to the project. It&apos;s an interested idea but there&apos;s no site, and we&apos;re not quite sure what they&apos;ve actually built this weekend?  Go Postal  The idea is to make it easier to stop junk mail. Users enter their name, address and a password, and when they enter they state which company has been spamming them. The site does the rest, sending a polite letter to the firm asking them to remove your details. It sends a follow up asking for confirmation the company to confirm it has complied: &quot;Would you confirm that I have been removed from your mail list, which is a legal obligation?&quot;  It also suggested alternative ways users could get information from that firm (a gesture to keep the companies sweeter, perhaps?) like their company blog, Facebook group, podcasts and Twitter feeds. Using Amee&apos;s carbon information, the site works out how much carbon has been saved according to the mail you were being sent, and how often it was being posted to you. There&apos;s just a holding site so far but this idea is extremely simple and well progressed. I&apos;m a fan.  postal.felixcohen.co.uk  We-need.org  The slickest presentation so far: This is an assessment system for people who need social support and care, many of whom spend most of their time with strangers, and have to apply for care through a confusing, time-consuming 56-page form. The technical teams had thought about the interface, and how a visual menu would be easier for this user group. Eventually the results could be plotted on a national map that will give a localised picture of regional need across the country.  Project leader Craig Griffin is convinced that this is a powerful and long-overdue initiative and he&apos;s hungry for money to take it further. A senior executive in a care fir told him that &quot;if you can create a smart interface with a set of rules that maps the requirements into an indicative budget allocation, I have half a dozen authorities who will have your hand off.&quot; What next? Griffin: &quot;This is what we have done in just one weekend with people we&apos;ve never met before. We need funding to take this to the next stage of a business road map, and we need data artists, web interface specialists.&quot;  Useful Visitors  How many of us went abroad this year and had some spare time? Trying to ingratiate themselves with the judges, the Useful Visitors team suggested it would be great to integrate the service with Dopplr. The site is fairly well advanced (at least they actually have one) - a rough prototype that took about 18 hours. The next version should be able to use the APIs from Facebook, LinkedIn and Dopplr, mobile entry, multiple languages and an automatic update to users after their trip to gather feedback. They want the project to be underwritten by corporations and have private-label versions for big organisations, and they would focus on Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya for launch.  The challenges? Getting to a critical mass of volunteers, quality control and security, and scaling up to new countries. Rather like the sofa surfing network, this seems like a great idea but there are complex logistical and practical problems in settings this up. It&apos;s a fabulous idea but, like many of the SICamp ideas, I wonder if it isn&apos;t just a bit too big to try and tackle here? Matt Biddulph of Dopplr asked: &quot;How do you keep people in that virtuous cycle of using the site and recommending it?&quot; The team said they envision developing a set of APIs so this could be incorporated into existing services.  Good Gym  &quot;My Name&apos;s Iva, and I don&apos;t really like gyms.&quot; This is a lovely and simple idea; athletes run useful errands instead of pounding a useless treadmill in the gym, and &apos;coaches&apos; get the benefit of human interaction and a newspaper, or fruit or their National Lottery numbers done. Feedback from runners and public on the street was very positive; most would want to do it if it was nearby and felt it would give them motivation to exercise.  The web interface is simple; athletes say how far they want to run, where they live and what kind of errands they can fulfill. A map shows where the coaches are and using pictures pulled from Flickr based on tags they show the needs of each person - what they need help with, what time of day and their interests. Great presentation, simple idea. GPs, daycare centres and social services would all link into the service, and after a period of testing the concept it would cost £1.79 for each errand.  OwnGrown  The project formerly known as Vegsy now describes itself an &quot;an online community for people who want to eat and grow ultra local, real food&quot;. It&apos;s another alternative to the ethical black hole of supermarkets and the worthy but overpriced farmers&apos; markets. The case: Half the vegetables and 95% of fruit eaten in the UK comes from overseas. There&apos;s a ten-year waiting list for some allotments. Sales of edible plants and seeds is up 70%. £1.7bn of fruit and vegetables i thrown away each year. One million people grow produce at home - and how much surplus do they have? That&apos;s the Owngrown market.  Congratulations on this team for actually building something; the site lets growers list their produce and matches them with people who want to buy it. They&apos;d make money by charging sales fees to bigger sellers and from some advertising. The first incarnation of the site is quite charming, but I have some doubts that this is the best way to sell vegetables - even if you can reserve 2lbs of Mrs Miggins&apos; carrots two weeks before they are harvested. There&apos;s something very tactile about buying vegetables - it allows consumers to check the quality and freshness of produce and also inspires them to buy more when they see.  owngrown.org  And the winner is...  If the presentations are anything to go by, SICamp is more of an ideas hack than about building things, and there&apos;s far more of an emphasis on building something that might evolve after the project - which takes some of the impetus away from that final Sunday deadline.  The point it taking of course, but somebody has to take the bounty home. &quot;All the teams have made progress, there&apos;s huge talent in the teams and well done everybody. You&apos;re all winners,&quot; said SICamp co-founder Paul Miller.  Second place - Useful Visitors. And first? Good Gym. Great stuff. Now go and sign up...

        <body>Alex Calderwood Founder: Ace HotelsAge: 38 Shaking up the hotel trade by blending luxury and budget  Calderwood is a leading creative force behind the Ace hotel group, one of the the most innovative in North America. In 2009, Ace will open hotels in New York and Palm Springs. &quot;Ultimately, we want the hotels to feel residential, like staying in someone&apos;s apartment,&quot; he says. The first Ace, in Seattle, broke several sacred rules when it opened in 1999. A former boarding house, most of the rooms had shared bathrooms, but the owners resisted the temptation to turn them all en suite. &quot;In a deck of cards the ace is both high and low. We chose it because we wanted the brand to appeal to every sort of traveller.&quot;  A room at the New York Ace, which opens in the spring, will start at $169 a night, rising to $700. &quot;Affordability is in our DNA,&quot; Calderwood says. &quot;It&apos;s not about being the cheapest but it is about delivering good value.&quot;  Ace hotels are also full of enjoyable quirks; the Seattle one has a laundry room: &quot;Our guests aren&apos;t into dry cleaning, but if you&apos;ve just flown in from Japan it&apos;s a luxury to be able to put your things in a washing machine in the middle of the night.&quot; The group&apos;s second hotel opened in Portland, Maine in 2007 and features turntables in the rooms and a library of vinyl. Palm Springs will have a bohemian edge to reflect its Californian heritage.   &quot;We didn&apos;t know anything about hotels when we started,&quot; says Calderwood. &quot;We just went on instinct.&quot;  • Top tip: &quot;Right now it&apos;s all about Japan. They have very creative solutions to space and culture. I know Tokyo well but this year I want to explore the rest of the country.&quot;   acehotel.com Lisa Sounio Founder: DopplrAge: 38 Holiday planning for the Facebook generation  Most social networking sites allow you to tell people where you have been. Dopplr.com lets you know where your friends - and their friends - are going to be. Sounio, who is based in Helsinki, and her friends came up with the idea in 2006: &quot;We were friends from all across the globe - San Francisco, London and Finland - and couldn&apos;t keep track of each other. All of us had spent a lonely night in a hotel in a foreign city, only to realise afterwards that a friend had been there at the same time without realising.  &quot;Dopplr helps you plan your travel and tells you what your carbon footprint is, using a clean, unfussy design. We hired a cottage near Brighton for a couple of days, ate spinach pasta and brainstormed until we came up with the kind of site we wanted. Dopplr is a social networking site, but it&apos;s more private than Facebook. We always wanted 1.5 million users and we&apos;re almost there. Some social networking sites can get too big too fast - people pile in to take a look and then get bored, but we want everyone to be active and get more out of travelling.&quot;   • Top tip: &quot;For me, it&apos;s the UK. Over the next year places close to us are going to become important, so people in Britain will rediscover the British coast and its cities. Britain might be in recession but the greatest business ideas still come from London.&quot;   dopplr.com Sharon Holmes Founder: Native Escapes Age: 38 Helping travellers see africa, up close and personal  Redundancy was the change Holmes needed to finally make the leap and become her own boss: &quot;I&apos;d always wanted to run my own business, and after seven years working in tourism marketing I felt I&apos;d learnt enough to give it a go. I&apos;d visited southern Africa several times and loved it - and knew from research and looking at tourist board statistics that visitor numbers were on the rise.&quot;  She was keen to work with suppliers, hoteliers and companies that offered the chance to connect with local people and put money into communities, giving travellers the opportunity to experience a more authentic, less sanitised version of southern Africa. Having talked to the tourist boards, she travelled to the countries she wanted to work with - Namibia, South Africa, Botswana and Zambia - to seek out likeminded businesses.  &quot;I met guides, visited lodges, checked out excursions and by last February I was ready to launch my own ethical tour company, Native Escapes - seven months after being made redundant.&quot;   • Top tip: &quot;In Botswana the government has allowed only limited tourism development, which means there are only a few lodges. Its pricey, but for a real wilderness trip with a lots of wildlife, it&apos;s unbeatable.&quot;  nativeescapes.com Graham Austick Founder: Piste to powder and Lyngen Lodge Age: 38Letting skiers get far from the madding crowd  Most mountain guides grow up in Alpine villages and follow their fathers&apos; crampon steps into the mountains. So it&apos;s all the more impressive that Austick, one of the most innovative guides working in Europe today, grew up in Newcastle and started out working for his dad&apos;s electrical engineering firm. &quot;After a while it was a case of &apos;Son, you ain&apos;t going to fit in here&apos;,&quot; he says. &quot;I spent every possible spare minute skiing, so pretty soon I decided I had to make it my career.&quot;   After parting company with his dad, aged 19, Austick moved to St Anton, Austria, and by 2000 had become the first Briton to have both the top British skiing-instruction qualification and the highest-level mountain guiding certificate. The same year, he set up Piste to Powder, a ski school specifically catering to the growing number of people who wanted to ski off-piste. Rather than hiring a private guide for at least &amp;pound;250 a day, it meant individuals could turn up, pay a flat fee (this winter &amp;pound;71) and join a group of a similar standard. A simple idea, but traditional Alpine ski schools have always been slow to innovate, and copycat operations are only now starting to pop up in the Alps.   But Austick didn&apos;t stop there. Recognising that more and more skiers were looking for adventures away from crowded resorts, he started running trips to ever more remote slopes - from Greenland to Alaska, Russia, the Himalayas and South America. Austick pushed into the least visited areas, until clients were skiing down mountains that had never been climbed, let alone skied before. In Alaska, the group travelled into the wilderness on a ski-equipped light aircraft then set up camp, in Greenland they arrived by dogsled.   Now Austick has a new focus - the Lyngen Alps in arctic Norway. &quot;When I first went I&apos;d never seen anywhere like it for skiing - super mountains, great snow, and your final turns finish on the beach where the waves are breaking.&quot; He started ski trips in the area based on a chartered sail boat, but has now built his own wilderness lodge, from which skiers are ferried by speed boat to different mountains each day. &quot;For your average alpine skier, the concept of skiing untracked powder, and ending up on the beach, is just bananas really.&quot;   • Top tip: &quot;Ski touring [using sticky skins attached to skis to climb uphill, rather than ski lifts] is coming into its own. Heliskiing is fun, but there&apos;s a level of stress that you don&apos;t get with ski touring. People are wanting to come back to the roots and get back to the real feeling of being in mountains.&quot;  www.pistetopowder.com; lyngenlodge.com Stevie Christie Director: Wilderness ScotlandAge: 31Sharing a love of adventure in the highlands and islands  What separates Wilderness Scotland from other similar companies is the local knowledge every member of staff has, which helps create its unique brand of holidays. Christie is no exception; he joined the company in 2003 as a mountain guide and still loves to get out on the mountains whenever he can.   &quot;I grew up in the area and after three years at the Scottish Executive, working on environmental policy, I knew I wanted a job that - at least partly - involved being outdoors,&quot; he says.   &quot;Wilderness Scotland was started by Neil Burnie and Paul Eastow in Neil&apos;s bedroom. They had both worked overseas on eco-projects in the developing world, but felt that no one was offering that type of holiday back in Scotland. The idea was to combine their experience of working in ecology, with their expert knowledge of the local area.&quot;  Alongside traditional hiking and mountain-biking holidays, Wilderness Scotland offers more unusual trips - kayaking, photography and family exploratory holidays - and has expanded its brand of eco-friendly holidays overseas. &quot;We set up a sister company about three years ago, Wilderness Journeys, which runs trips to remoter parts of Kenya, South America and Bhutan. All the trips work with local people, and ensure the economic benefits go to the local community.&quot;   Wilderness Scotland is run on green principles, and is introducing an optional payment of &amp;pound;5-&amp;pound;10 per booking, matched by the company, to go to nominated environmental projects.  • Top tip: &quot;The credit crunch means more people will be holidaying in the UK - as they should. Scotland is the adventure capital of Europe, and has some of the best mountain-biking and kayaking in the world.&quot;  wildernessscotland.com Jamie Andrews Co-founder: Loco2travel Age: 25Finding a viable alternative to flying   The idea was conceived by Jamie&apos;s sister Kate, who wanted to travel after university and found there were limited resources for people who wanted to make long-haul journeys without flying. &quot;She mocked up the website, but the problem was that it was almost impossible to create a journey planning tool that could combine global information on bus, train, boat and ferry links,&quot; he says. &quot;At this point it was just an idea, and Kate decided to go travelling.&quot;  This was where Jamie came in; having worked for a web development company, he created the current loco2travel.com website. &quot;It&apos;s very much a version 1.0 at the moment,&quot; he says. &quot;There are two main strands we&apos;re working on. The journey planner is integral to what we want the site to be. But the other strand is to enable people to have authentic gap-year experiences; to travel overland and get involved in projects as you travel.&quot;  Andrews admits travelling overland can be daunting, and loco2 aims to set up itineraries - including placements with community projects - to make it easier. &quot;We want to be useful for those who want to travel on a whim, and for those planning a whole adventure.&quot;  • Top tip: &quot;Convergence on Copenhagen is about bringing people together who are travelling to November&apos;s Climate Conference without flying. Using the internet, they can join up and stay together on their way to Denmark - a kind of &apos;secular pilgrimage&apos;.&quot;  loco2travel.com Verity Bertram Founder: 20 daysAge: 30Removing the stress of organising a group getaway   After running her university&apos;s branch of Busc (the British Universities Sports Council) and a year in Australia organising sporting events, Bertram saw a gap in the market for a company specialising in group trips and days out. &quot;Organising a group holiday can be a nightmare,&quot; she says, &quot;but it&apos;s something I&apos;ve always enjoyed, and felt that people would really use a company that took over all the administration.&quot; She started the website at the end of 2006 with a 25-person trip to Puerto Ban&amp;uacute;s in Spain, and the business has built steadily.   &quot;There are two aspects to the firm,&quot; she says. &quot;The first is where we put on an event or a holiday - we organise transport, accommodation, excursions, find the best bars and restaurants - and people sign up in any number to join the group, from one to 40. The second is where a group comes to us - either corporate or friends - who might want a ski trip to Switzerland or to go kite-surfing in Italy, and we organise the holiday for them.   &quot;We&apos;ve also introduced &apos;Snowdays&apos;, where we book a variety of accommodation in a ski resort and arrange entertainment and excursions people can join in or not as they like. People nominate a group leader and use their name when booking on the site. We collate all the bookings, then contact the group leader with the information, so no one has to take responsibility for booking the whole trip.&quot;   • Top tip: &quot;Holidays are going to be the new hunting ground for singles - the days of &apos;singles holidays&apos; as such, are long gone. The web is making it much easier to find like-minded people for a trip abroad.&quot;  20days.co.uk Tom Dawe and Lisa Knights Founders: Yurtelage: 29 and 34Taking the mud and the misery out of festival-going  The original idea behind Yurtel was a mobile spa business; Dawe and Knights were both massage therapists who decided to create a spa they would take to festivals. &quot;We wanted to offer massages and treatments but weren&apos;t sure what kind of structure to use. We decided on a yurt and in 2007, we took just one yurt around the country, offering treatments,&quot; says Dawes.   While at the festivals, they realised that although there were companies offering &quot;comfortable accommodation&quot;, a gap in the market remained.   &quot;There was nothing particularly luxurious, and we felt yurts could offer that, so we went back to the guy in Devon where we had bought our first one and ordered 12 more. We then set up a mobile hotel: each yurt has a kingsized bed and fresh flowers, and we still offer the spa treatments. At some festivals we offer a B&amp;amp;B service - fresh croissants and coffee.&quot;   Yurtel&apos;s clients tend to be older people who might not go to festivals if it meant toughing it out under canvas, and they intend to up the luxury factor.   &quot;We&apos;re looking to add five more yurts and also a shower and toilet trailer.&quot; But Dawe admits that their long-term goal is a touch more glamorous: &quot;Our ultimate dream is a health retreat somewhere overseas. We&apos;re heading to Goa next month to look at possible locations.&quot;  • Top tip: &quot;As the recession bites, holidaying in the UK will become more popular. With stress levels increasing, people will be looking to nurture their mind, body and soul at affordable destinations within the UK.&quot;   yurtel.co.uk </body>

        <body> Welcome to XTech in Paris, a conference that looks just over the horizon into the near future or, in many cases, the advanced present of the internet. This is not your parents&apos; internet. It is an internet freed from the not only the desktop, but the computer entirely.  The schedule for the conference is here. If there is anything you&apos;d like to know or anyone you&apos;d like to put a question to, leave a comment, and I&apos;ll do my best to get you some answers. WiFi is a little scarce here, oddly, so I&apos;ll be online as much as possible but not as much as I&apos;d like. Everywhere internet, design, location-based services, web app development is just a taster of the topics covered.   Technorati Tags: web2.0, XTech, XTech2007      UPDATE: The WiFi situation is pretty bad, and I can only get online in between sessions. This is going to be a bit raw as I&apos;m liveblogging and then running up to my room to get online. Apologies for the subsequent butchery of English. Hopefully the ideas come through and aren&apos;t obscured.  Software becomes &apos;Everyware&apos;  Adam Greenfield kicked off the second day with a keynote that looked at the broader implications of the increasing reach of networked technology in our lives. (I missed the first day, but you can find a lot of posts by searching  XTech in Technorati.) He said that he comes from the confrontation of human beings with technology. He looks at how people use technology, and he says that he feels their pain.  What is ubiquitous or pervasive computing? He said that very little of what he was going to talk about will deal with the web. He wanted to talk about what he calls Everyware (Get it? Software goes everywhere.) Back in 1990, Mark Weiser thought about embedded, wireless computing that went far beyond the desktop computer, beyond a GUI. It automates and digitises all kinds of &apos;unheroic tasks of everyday life&apos;.  He gave examples such as a digital doorlock that is part of everyday life in Korea. You can use bluetooth, a biometric scanner or even a plain old key to open your door. Technology is &apos;going to the body&apos;, and he gave the example of the Nike+ iPod, where not only would it gather your exercise information but allow you to share that with others. The world becomes your exercise partner.  There is an emergent &apos;internet of things&apos;. All of these services communicate not just with human beings but also with each other.  A class of systems tends to colonise everyday life. We&apos;re in France, so Adam gave a reference to Michel Foucault&apos;s idea of the Panopticon (UPDATE: as Mark notes in the comments, the Panopticon was originally an idea by Jeremy Bentham that was extended by Foucault). The prisoners never knew whether they were being surveilled so they had to assume that they were always being surveilled.  How does this impact us now? He gave the example of the Kinko, a networked toilet. It would analyse your bodily wastes and transmit information to your doctor. Surveillance becomes not just the watchful gaze but a product of the technological systems deployed in everyday life that gather a lot of data.  Is this all science fiction? No, he believes that this is a present, real-world concern. Most of the time he has had to illustrate his talk with prototypes, but the systems are now becoming real-world, commercially available products.  For example, he says that the new internet protocol, the 128-bit address space IPv6, provides some 6.5 to 10 to 23 power addresses for every square meter of the earth. You can give an internet address to almost every object in the world. Seem ludicrous? He gave the example of proliphix.com, a service for networked thermostats.  He&apos;s worried that most people see ubiquitous computing as unproblematic. What do you have to consider? Inadvertency. They didn&apos;t mean to engage this system. Now, what happens when people don&apos;t know about the system or are unwilling to engage with that system? And with all of these interlocking systems, there may be a lot of unintended consequences. One system triggers another and causes a cascade of unintended and unwanted results in systems around it.  It&apos;s time to take everyware seriously, he says. He laid down a few principles that he believes need to be considered as these systems are developed (someone in the audience echoed what I thought that his principles mirrored Asimov&apos;s laws of robotics).  Principle 1: Default to harmlessness. Ensure users&apos; physical, psychic and financial safety, but realise that means different things to different cultures. Principle 2: Be self-disclosing. Seamlessness must be optional, and it has to be clear who owns them, what they use and what they do. Principle 3: Be conservative of face. They must not embarrass, humiliate or shame their users. We have to build systems that operate a high degree of precision but then &apos;fog&apos; those results in imprecision. Principle 4: Be conservative of time. Don&apos;t make life more complicated than it already is. Principle 5: Be deniable. People have to be able to say &apos;no&apos;.  Open API to counter climate change  Gavin Starks with d:gen networks spoke about climate change and quoted a statistic from World Changing. We ship 2.4 trillion kg of cargo from port to port per year. It&apos;s like shipping every human being six times. &quot;Isn&apos;t that insane?&quot;, he asks.  Temperatures are expected to rise between 1.8 to 4 degrees Celsius, according to the Climate Group. The last time this happened 125,000 years ago, the sea was 4 to 6 metres higher. We are looking at hundreds of millions of people under threat. The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change said that greenhouse gas emissions need to be 75% lower by 2050.  He argued that 75% of that reduction could come from current technologies. We could get a quarter of the way through conservation and increased efficiency. Wouldn&apos;t it be great if we could shut down some power stations? Two years ago, he was asked: &quot;How would you get a billion people to reduce their carbon emissions by one tonne per year?&quot;  I can&apos;t just click somewhere to absolve my life if I want to reduce my energy consumption by 85%. We need more than a campaign. We need a movement. We are missing a development framework. What would we build? What should we do?  There needs to be trust in the information. To scale, we need to share tools. We need to give away the tools and share things. We don&apos;t need to re-invent the wheel, build another carbon calculator. We need an available engine, that we can trust and share and remembers what I&apos;ve done. It needs to be extensible and open.  In December of last year, he got a call from the UK government and got all the data and calculations from the government. They have their own scientists who add data, and they source every single item of data. They have created a &apos;profiling engine&apos;. Anyone can run a campaign and use anonymous keys to share stats. They are giving it away for free via GPL.  He sees toolkits for schools, builders. Use RFID versions to &apos;track the trackers&apos;. He sees league tables for the good and the bad. Data sets over districts, regions and campaigns to create competitions to cut carbon emissions. He wants to integrate it with Pledgebank. How do you integrate this with Google, Flickr, Dopplr, Twitter, Make or NagMe?  They have a generic engine with generic anonymous keys that allow the sharing of data. Let us be very clear that it&apos;s not the planet we&apos;re saving, but its species and most notably our own.  It is launching today. The site it launching today. Go to http://www.dgen.net/amee  AMEE=Avoiding Mass Extinction Engine  There are database issues and database rights issues. We have some potentially big privacy issues. We have done our best to keep it anonymous, but there is still a need to protect this information.  Ian Forrester, with BBC Backstage, asked what public broadcasters like the BBC can do, and Gavin said, &quot;You already are.&quot; He would not go into details.  Matt Biddulph is building Dopplr, a traveller site that allows people to show where they are travelling. It helps people let their friends know if they will be in the same city at the same time.  &quot;It is not a competition,&quot; Matt said. He wants to know how the site might work with this service. The site is in a private beta at the moment. (I use it, but I think I&apos;ve given away all of my invitations.) Dopplr users have booked 9 million miles of air travel, Matt added.  Jabber: Social Software for Robots  Blaine Cook, Obvious Corp Kellan Elliot-McCrea, Flickr/Yahoo!  Flickr and Twitter. We say we put the point in Web 2.0, they say.  Social software is people asking computers to talk to people. Your actions are aggregated in one place.  It took me a while to get my head around what they were talking about, mostly because I use web services. I can&apos;t code. After a while, I figured it out. They were talking about using messaging protocols, in this case the Jabber messaging service, for computers to talk to each other rather than people chatting online. It gets around some of the problems of pushing around real-time information between computers without the computers idling and waiting for information. The &apos;Are we there yet?&apos; problem.  There are big clouds of data floating around, and the current models are breaking down. &quot;It makes computers cry&quot;, Kellan said, adding, &quot;We say at Flickr that we make computers cry everyday.&quot;  Let&apos;s consider a new model for web services. Message passing through asynchronous communications. The computer asks: Let me know when we&apos;re there. When it is, the server says, &quot;We&apos;re there&quot;. Social software for robots is message passing.  Where it works? It&apos;s not actually useful for everything, but it&apos;s good for real time and wire level data with no database interaction. It doesn&apos;t work so much with historical and static content or interactive searches.  What we&apos;re thinking about is a real-time Craig&apos;s List. In San Francisco, it&apos;s really important if you want to rent an apartment. If you could see that listing when you&apos;re out on the street, you can get the apartment. But if you poll the IP every three seconds, then you&apos;ll be blocked under current models.  What happens when you&apos;re fishing for information? Tell a little bot that you want to know when a new apartment is listed on Craig&apos;s List. You put a net out, and you&apos;ll get notified when you catch something. It&apos;s important when you&apos;re waiting for something to happen as opposed to looking for historical information.  How do you build it? Jabber. It&apos;s usually considered a messaging protocol, but it&apos;s a standard. You can do internet scale message passing. It&apos;s just XML. You can do this securely and verify the identity of the sender. No spoofing!  This brings up a whole new set of services. Private, secure services.  &quot;It&apos;s hard to talk about how cool this?&quot; We can have the server asking the client what&apos;s new.  If a server is processing a 100MB wav file, the client gets in the way of the processing by asking &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; Is the processing done? Instead, they can use Jabber to pass the message of when the task is completed instead the client pestering the server needlessly.  Jabber is asynchronous, real-time, extensible, secure, delegated. It has callbacks. It&apos;s standardised. It has presence. It is decentralised but not P2P. (Sorry, I&apos;m going to leave that one hanging there for the code-literate amongst you.)  The http protocol, one of the most common protocols on the web, just doesn&apos;t work for everything. It calls and waits for a response. With real-time information, the number of data calls quickly becomes problematic, especially if the response is a long time in coming.  Jaiku: Rich Presence.  Ralph Meijer:  Jaiku  We used to use mobile phones just to call people. Later on, you had contact lists to make it faster to call them. But how do you know if they are there? If they are available? Maybe the person you&apos;re trying to call is in the theatre, busy or driving.  But now you can have pervasive net connectivity. You can find out where a person is. You can have many-to-many communications. They have written Jaiku for S60 phones, the OS for many Nokia phones. You can see your contacts and what the person was doing recently. Your contacts can know what you are doing and if you are busy.  They use cell tower information and bluetooth neighbourhood information to give a sense of presence, some location information. They have worked to integrate calendar data. On some of the newer mobile phones, you can show your friends your photos to allow them to see what you are seeing. They are working to balance battery use and the need for frequent if not persistent connection to the mobile data network.  Jaiku also is on the web. You can send messages. You can also pull in web feeds from your blog, Flickr, last.fm or Twitter. People selectively subscribe to your feeds to keep a balance between knowing what their friends are doing and being overwhelmed with information. You can add comments to other people&apos;s blog posts or Flickr pictures.  Jaiku pulls together a lot of the social applications through RSS and aggregates this information in one place as well as making this &apos;lifestream&apos; mobile. They also are working on an SMS service. They have created &apos;channels&apos; or groups. They recently did this for the Eurovision song contest.  They use most modern web technologies like JSON, RSS and Atom, different ways to distribute all kinds of data and information such as blog posts, a listing of your latest Flickr photos or your podcasts.  He is asked about something between location and presence so letting someone know you are home without specifying where home is. Ralph says that the XMPP protocol, which is used quite a bit in Jaiku, allows you to specify how much information that you&apos;d like to publish. You don&apos;t have to publish exact GPS coordinates. You can be as precise or fuzzy as you&apos;d like.  On Jaiku, you can also set your messages to be public or private to determine how widely the information is available, to everyone or just your contacts.  Why did they include RSS? We think your personal feeds are part of the complete picture of what you are up to.  What about the data prices? Some of these services can cost a lot of money with all of the data being passed.  We are talking with various telco providers to arrange something in that area. SMS aren&apos;t very expensive. In the Netherlands and Finland, you see smaller providers providing flat fee data plans. We are counting on always-on data plans.  What is your provenance?  Gavin Bell:  Nature  This talk is about identity on the internet. I get frustrated with the pace the people push things forward. I want to look at slower expression of who we are.  Provenance is the history of an object. Who has handled it? What are the dates and times of who owned it? He gives the example of a Rothko that was sold this week for £74 million. It had very good provenance. It sold for a lot of money because it had a clear history of ownership that could be validated.  People think about the internet as web pages, but each one of those pages is created by person. The photos on Flickr are taken by a person.  At Nature, they found that most people prefer things that have been recommended to them. Gavin asked: &quot;In 10 years, what devices will we have? How will we find people? How will our identity be created?&quot; Identity used to be about profession, but then it became post codes and phone numbers as well. And now, identity is connected to e-mail as well.  Gavin shows four of the IDs that he uses online. Off the top of my head, I can think of six IDs that I commonly use or have uses. Gavin shows off the IDs that he uses on different sites such as tumblr.com or del.icio.us. Our existence is distributed with blogs posts, photos or even the wine we drink on site like Cork&apos;d.  Is this solved with something like OpenID? Ostensibly this is only authentication, but OpenID can also be used as a representation of myself. hCard has the rel=&quot;me&quot; microformat. Microformats are an emerging way of adding semantic data to elements on webpages.  But beyond who I am, we can look at our contacts in social networks. We have pages that says who I am and who my friends are. There are ways to connect social networks.  Can my output, the things I&apos;ve created, be summed up? There are lots of metadata and geolocation information through tags and summaries. &quot;People keep asking me to join the LinkIn network,&quot; he said, &quot;but I&apos;m already part of a network called the Internet.&quot; via Jon Udell   What is a tag? Ruby? To some, a programming language. To others, a song by the Kaiser Chiefs. To others, it means a gem. It relies on context.  In his own investigation, Gavin has found a bit of serendipity in how people find content through tags. Nature Network is using this to help  Can I sum up the output of my friends and figure out who knows what? Gavin is trying to focus this on people instead of RSS feeds. How does someone find via Google someone who knows a specific bit of information, can perform a specific task or might be a good speaker at a conference? How do we use social relationships to find other people who have the information or expertise that I&apos;m looking for?  He shows off a page that he has created using the XFN microformat rel=&quot;me&quot;. It helps pull together a portrait of Gavin as a person. He is using a service called hpricot to add tags, people and photos from Flickr. It&apos;s a screen scraper that looks for specified information in a webpage and spits it out as structured data.  He has created an arc of his identity through Flickr, Del.icio.us and Upcoming.com through the social software sites and back again. But it works on several sites including vox, mag.nolia, and Cork&apos;d. Through publicly available data, he has created profiles of his friends to see what they are doing, their sites and how he is connected to them. It is private. It&apos;s just his view of his friends. I don&apos;t want to create a service for stalkers.   This is about surfacing your friends from a sea of feeds. Is this a new type of application? Is this a plug-in for your feed reader? Is it a desktop app? A website is probably the easiest thing to do, but the bandwidth bill might be hideous. It&apos;s an aggregation of network effects.  How it works. Login in with OpenID. Scan the page. Find friends and e-mail a notice when it&apos;s done. Rinse and repeat.  Is this scary? There are privacy and disclosure issues. This is data that we&apos;ve all given out freely and openly. As we live more and more of our lives online, it becomes more and more important to think about what we put up online. It could be a Utopian or distopian service depends on who runs the services, one friend pointed out to Gavin.  There are some unsettling possibilities with the ability to do this. Could a person be passed over for promotion or for a job because of what they have done online?  Identity consolidation is real, and this is about people not feeds. Microformats are really useful but not widely used yet. There are details of the project on idsix.com.  Questions: There was an interesting question about personnas. Antiques are an object, but people take on certain personnas online. How do you keep those separate?  Facebook and LinkedIn don&apos;t support his kind of service because they require a login. People may want to keep some of their identity private.  Vox is like LiveJournal. It has privacy built in. You can keep your entire profile hidden.  Question: You can start to create visualisations on who are my friends and friends, friends. With my digital rights, that gives me the willies? How to protect people from malicious use?  Answer: You must be able to authenticate who you are. You must use OpenID. If they have rel=&quot;me&quot; on their website, you can find out reams about that person. What we are doing enables a lot of non-permissions based activity to happen. We have made explicit decisions to publish. We think these are my photos on Flickr and these are my friends.  As Internet users, privacy and partial privacy are things we need to educate people about. </body>

        <body> The world, they say, gets smaller every day. We travel more than ever, and almost everyone has a story about bumping into friends, family or colleagues in some faraway place.  Those who spend a lot of time on the road know how lonely it can be, and having an idea of who will be in town during your travels can make a huge difference to your time away.  That&apos;s where one new web service, Dopplr.com, wants to make a difference. It&apos;s a social network that focuses purely on your travel plans - and those of the people you know - in order to encourage serendipitous meetings.  Sign up and tell Dopplr where you&apos;re going and who you know, and you&apos;ll be alerted (online or on your mobile) every time somebody you know crosses your path.   And while the site was built by a team of globetrotting world citizens, it&apos;s not just for people who rack up millions of air miles – the service works just as well for keeping tabs on friends and family as they scoot around the country.  The most hyper-connected web monkeys will be able to incorporate Dopplr into their other social networks (like Facebook) with ease, and new features are being added all the time as the site grows.  At the moment it&apos;s invitation-only, but when it opens up to the world later this year you might just start to hear big things about this little website. </body>

        <body> On Friday, the team from guardian.co.uk attended the dConstruct 2008 conference in a rainy Brighton. We&apos;re also really happy to have been a sponsor of this event.  As well as our very own Aleks Krotoski, speakers included Steven Johnson, Joshua Porter, and Jeremy Keith of Clearleft.    If I had to pick a highlight from what was a great day - for me it was the talk by  Matt&apos;s Jones and Biddulph of Dopplr.   They always give a good presentation, and this was no exception. Dopplr appear to be at the forefront where it comes to integration between their service and various other services on the web.   The part that caught my interest was Matt Biddulph&apos;s call to web developers/engineers to start looking into asynchronous message queues, and how these technologies are helping to stitch together the various connected, but independent services which make up Dopplr.  We&apos;re also attending (and sponsoring) Barcamp Brighton 3 - the unconference following on after dConstruct 2008 - I&apos;ll post about that next. </body>

        <body> Dopplr designer Matt Jones was rather a hit on the &apos;good ideas for mobile&apos; panel this afternoon, moving the discussion away from the usual debate about device design and frustrations with operators.  He sees mobile as something of a super power device and described something he calls &quot;bionic noticing&quot; - obsessively recording curious things he sees around him, driven by this multi-capable device in his pocket.  &quot;Making maps and taking photos and sucking photons out of the city and putting them up on Flickr. It&apos;s the thing I can&apos;t do without now - this remembering machine,&quot; he said.  He&apos;s frustrated with the disembodied way that we engage with mobile devices: &quot;beautiful shiny plastic things with some gangly bag of mostly water tapping away on them&quot;.  &quot;We should be an embodied person in the world rather than a disembodied finger tickling a screen walking down the street. We need to unfold and unpack the screen into the world.&quot;  Mobile must recognise &apos;place&apos; over location  Jones likes to follow inanimate objects on Twitter (Tower Bridge and Nasa probes, for example) because they make him feel connected to the city. (This makes more sense when you understand the objectives of Dopplr, the travel community site that Jones runs.)  &quot;We need to understand the difference between location and place. Computers and mobiles are very good at location, but we describe where we are as place, where culture meets location. Our whereabouts. Pirate maps, and scribbled landmarks. As long as we still have a bit of energy and money, that&apos;s where we going.&quot;   Matt Jones of Dopplr. Photograph: adactio/Flickr/Some rights reserved  Among his other golden nuggets were: &quot;I hope someone comes up with the Nintendo Wii for Apple&apos;s PlayStation&quot;, a friend who&apos;d described switching on GPS as &quot;switching the sky on&quot; and a quote by Stanford professor Donald Knuth who observed that: &quot;Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things.&quot;  Jones also said some of the most interesting work in mobile is being done on &apos;situated software&apos;, or very niche, very location specific tools that seem to have a limited purpose. But link all these up, and you have a new, potentially global integrated system.  Liberated by dongles  3G dongles and mobile phones has completely changed the way TechCrunch UK editor Mike Butcher works, he said.  He&apos;s no longer desk bound and can work from anywhere. There are drawbacks to this; he&apos;s addicted to his iPhone, which he loves because of the big screen and the way he lives on his RSS feeds, twitter, Yammer and email. But that causes a lot of tension at home, especially when he can&apos;t resist the temptation to check them all on family holidays.  He pointed out that the potential of the iPhone has only just begun; if they could be fitted with all kinds of instruments and be turned into a giant global censor; measuring carbon emission, temperature and more. He cited Berlin-based startup Aka-Aki as one of the more convincing mobile social networks which connects you to the people around you in a more passive way.   </body>
