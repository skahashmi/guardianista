      <trail-text> Yesterday's announcement that Twitter is cutting SMS support outside the US, Canada and India had the Twitterati up in arms. Co-founder Biz Stone explained that Twitter had been trying to strike a deal with mobile operators to keep the service going but basically can't afford to do it: "Even with a limit of 250 messages received per week, it could cost Twitter about $1,000 per user, per year to send SMS outside of Canada, India, or the US..." bemoaned Stone. </trail-text>

        <body> Yesterday's announcement that Twitter is cutting SMS support outside the US, Canada and India had the Twitterati up in arms. Co-founder Biz Stone explained that Twitter had been trying to strike a deal with mobile operators to keep the service going but basically can't afford to do it: "Even with a limit of 250 messages received per week, it could cost Twitter about $1,000 per user, per year to send SMS outside of Canada, India, or the US..." bemoaned Stone.   Photo by sittered on Flickr. Some rights reserved.  For the non-Twitterers among you, you can send and receive messages from twitter on the Twitter site, through a whole bunch of third-party desktop applications like Twitterrific and Twhirl or - and this was the special part - through SMS on your mobile. There are applications for the iPhone and for other mobiles, but these are passive rather than a text message alert. Twitterers can still send outgoing messages from their phones, but lose incoming messages.  Cue, then, the campaign on Twitter; changing picture icons to a pic that demands the UK operators come up with a solution, as well as a meme of Twitter bombing Biz Stone saying 'boo'! More interestingly, there's a raft of startups and rival sites taking advantage of the situation to plug their own services.   Twitter themselves suggested using a mobile-specific application like slandr, Cellity or Twitterberry.  • TweetSMS wasted no time; they will launch soon offering incoming Twitter SMS for a fee, apparently set up because they knew this scenario was coming. No details yet on the exact costs; the site just says "a small fee at a fraction of the cost of a text message".  • Zygo Tweet also have a registration site live and plan to launch in a month. Users will buy a bunch of credits to receive direct messages and replies, and those will be between 4-5p. It will work internationally and is run by a team of ex-Orange engineers.  Twitter is incredibly powerful, and I don't doubt that I'd pay for the whole service. But paying to receive messages could be very problematic; it could lead people to cut down the number of people they follow, restrict the number of messages and communication they have - in short, it will change the dynamic of it. Are you worth paying to receive texts from?  Twitter is said to be seeing more growth in the UK than anywhere, and won't want to damage that. Users will hope that might encourage operators to seize the opportunity to offer a solution or a deal with Twitter. Now's their chance.  </body>

      <type-specific class="article">
        <body> There's a thread of accidental anarchy in Biz Stone's masterclass. The Twitter co-founder started at art school and ended up on Twitter via a book publisher, web design, a blogging tool and a podcasting project. The common thread, he said, is creativity.  "Creativity is a renewable resource - it never runs out," he said.  "Creating an atmosphere where creativity is welcome is the bext thing you can do. We couldn't plan for Twitter stuff to happen - we got money for Odeo and Twitter happened. Even Blogger was a side project. There's no end to them."  Odeo was a podcasting project that Ev Williams, co-founder of Twitter, had been playing with at the time, but a demo of the product at a TED talk went down so well that they ended up with a New York Times feature and $5m in funding. The demo, Stone confesses, was better than the product.  "None of us were even using our own thing, the thing we were supposed to be excited about. We weren't even podcasters - we all listened to music on our iPods. We ended up feeling worried that we'd taken this money for Odeo but were starting to use it for Twitter."    API increases traffic 20-fold  If we needed any proof about the value of spin-off applications - like those that made Facebook great - Twitter has it.  The site gets 20 times more traffic because of its API, said co-founder Biz Stone, and also enables development of the product outside the company.  Users have suggested audio Twitter, video Twitter and any number of "kooky features", but they can "use the API and developer community as a way of avoiding adding features to the core system that shouldn't be there".  The priority for Twitter is performance and reliability for the service, he said, and that often means saying no. Right now, focusing on those priorities mean "saying no to everything, just so we can get things done".  Twitter really took off at the tech conference South by South West. "The best stuff always happens in the hallways," said Stone, so Twitter set up screens and filtered SXSW-relevant Twitters to delegates around the conference. The result was an obsessive following of people who used Twitter to coordinate socialising and "self-organising" around the event, and it continued to spiral from there.  Never mind the churn  How do you stop people leaving the service? "You don't," said Stone. "You recognise that is what people do, and plan and allow for that churn." That also means making it easy for people to move to another service if they want to.  Stone was asked about fickle social networkers, who might jump from xanga.com to MySpace to Facebook in a short period of time. But those are 'I'm here' services, said Stone, that want you to stay inside their sites. Twitter moves with you, physically, because of the SMS element.  There's a move towards enabling people to move more easily form one service to another, he said; in the early days of the web people resisted linking away to other sites, but then Google disrupted that by building a business that did nothing but link. "There's a value in sending them away because if you do a good enough job of sending them away, they will come back."  "We're a device-agnostic message-routing company"  So where's Twitter going? It just launched in India - which will be absolutely massive, and viral - but they will continue until either they don't like it anymore or it becomes too big.  They are speaking to carriers about working together on SMS packages, but that has taken an extraordinarily long time. And monetising Twitter is not a priority yet, though that would most likely be done by charging advertisers to send out messages to followers and by future deals with carriers.  "We don't see ourselves as a web company. We see ourselves as a device-agnostic message routing company, so we'd really like to recruit people from Reuters or Bloomberg to come and work for us. That's what we need to focus on."  Twitter's attitude towards the press is very different to that of Google, where Stone used to work. "No-one was ever allowed to say anything. Things would be handed out and they'd say 'here's what we're telling you. Be happy with that.'"  "We're very different. We've never put out any press releases. We just ask 'now what do you want to know?'" </body>

      <type-specific class="article">
        <body> There were three things I wanted to ask Twitter co-founder Biz Stone at the Silicon Valley Comes to Oxford conference yesterday. The first was about those swirling rumours of an attempted Facebook acquisition.  How would the Twitter community react to a takeover by a more mainstream site, and one where the most obvious use for Twitter would be an integration with rather restrictive status updates?    "There are some interesting overlaps," said Stone, "and most of those are complementary."  Complementary, but surely Twitter is far more flexible and diverse as a platform than the more rigidly controlled Facebook site would allow?  "Twitter's goal has always been to create a sustainable new company around the concept of this unique form of communication we have created."  Creating a 'sustainable' company before selling it would mean it was worth far more, but equally support from Facebook could mean a more commercial focus.  "We've been working together with Facebook - obviously we have the Facebook app, and you can set Twitter updates to update your Facebook status. But both of those are a little different. The analogy there is that the Facebook status update is 'I'm headed to Boston' and then the whole time I'm in Boston, I'm Twittering that 'I'm getting doughnuts', 'I'm eating doughnuts', 'I'm on third street with doughnuts'. And then when you get back online, you'd say 'I'm back from Boston'. It's a different use case."  "Ultimately what we do is complementary to the big social networks. Twitter is not a social network but a communication tool that has social elements to it. You don't just follow people - you find sources and choose what is important to you.  Sorting out full SMS support in the UK?  "It's not something we can flip a switch on. It needs a lot of deliberation and business development, but we're hiring aggressively for ten new positions including business development as hopefully these new people will really get on the front lines of mobile and negotiate so we can get the full, true spirit of Twitter working again.  "Ideally we'll negotiate this in-house," rather than as services offered by third parties, he said.  Commercialising Twitter  The third thing - making money from Twitter. When I spoke to fellow co-founder Ev Williams just over a year ago, he was already talking about brands paying a premium to use the service rather than slapping ads in Twitter feeds. Stone elaborated.  "The first brand we really saw shining was ComCast. One blogger said he was going to writ a post tomorrow slamming ComCast and it would be the number one post on a Google search for ComCast. They replied immediately and sent a van round to his house within an hour to fix his cable, and the next day his post praised ComCast for their amazing customer service."  He said JetBlue and Wholefoods were doing a similar thing - a quirky, hybrid mix of customer service and marketing.  "What we're going to try to start focusing on next is the big brands on Twitter who are getting a lot of value out of it and have a lot of followers. They're getting value and the customers are getting value so it makes sense to enter a relationship with the where we offer more value at a price.  "But we have an iterative approach - we don't want to unveil a secret weapon. We'll just put stuff out and see what happens."  The Mars Phoenix cruiser &amp;amp; jail in Egypt  He also spoke about some of the major Twitter events of the past few months. The Mars Phoenix project happened to coincide with publicity for the film Wall E, which perfectly set the tone for the anthropomorphised updates on its exploration of the red planet. In a few short weeks, Mars Pheonix built a following of nearly 40,000 people on Twitter and finally injected some energy into Nasa's mission to get the public engaged with science "So we learned through Twitter that Phoenix had verified water ice on Mars."  "Nasa traditionally gets some science, everything goes through PR and then it comes back weeks later very dry. It's the same process for blogging - but somehow Twitter updates were allowed."  The second was the case of the photojournalism student James Buck who left UC Berkeley for Egypt because he wanted to photograph some exciting stuff. He found out about Twitter in Egypt when he asked activists how they were co-ordinating so quickly - and when he found himself arrested he quickly Twittered 'arrested' when he realised they hadn't taken his phone away.  Back home, friends knew what he had been up to and took the tweet seriously. The dean of the school called the lawyer, who called the consulate, and he was out within two hours. And then he Twittered "free". </body>

        <body> I hope you weren't planning on getting any sleep tonight, because the world and his internet-obsessed wife will be expecting you to be glued to your media screens for the next 24 hours to watch the US election drama unfold.  It's not just all TV, of course. Robert Andrews over on our sister site paidContent:UK has an overview of coverage on UK news sites but we've got a few more online alternatives, just to cover all bases.  • Web TV aggregator Livestation combines some major-name international TV news services in one place, which will make for an interesting mix of perspectives that include euronews, France 24, C-Span, Russia Today, Deutsche Welle and Al-Jazeera English. You'll need to download Livestation, but it does now support Mac and Linux as well as PCs and, particularly as it's free, it's a very efficient way to flick between all this content in one place. It's all completely legal (there are other live web TV services that are slightly less so...) and backed by no other than Chris Cramer, former head of newsgathering at the BBC and most recently of CNN. Part of the Livestation appeal is that it is interactive, with a chat function and a breaking news alerts tool. And it's designed to sit modestly in the corner of your screen until something exciting happens, and then you can full screen it.    • Current TV is performing a viewer-generated election coverage bonanza with the tagline 'no pundits - just perspective', aggregating views from various social media platforms including Digg and Twitter. The 'Election All-nighter LIVE' will combine video comment from 12seconds.tv and Current with live Digg headlines and aggregated Twitter comments. Twitter co-founder Biz Stone described this as "helping Twitter amplify the opinions, news and trends that matter". Data added to the feed will include a scoreboard for each Electoral college result across the US, in the manner of Peter Snow's swingometer. If you're a Twitterer, add the tag #current to your tweets and they'll be picked up. Plenty more live coverage suggestions on NewTeeVee.  • Digg doesn't need much of an excuse for a party, and this is as good as any. Its election night viewing party will undoubtedly be the ultimate destination for beer-swilling football-loving developers whether online or in person at Partysville, San Francisco. Highlights from the party will be shown on Current and, with a bit of luck, the guys won't get so drunk that they fall asleep before the final result.  • As a follow up to Digg's election night coverage, Current chairman Al Gore will be a Digg Dialogg guest tomorrow and will be answering questions about the results. Question go live at midnight on Wednesday and the show will air on Current at 10pm - all pacific time.  • The New York Times has a swathe of election-covering tools from the obligatory up-to-the-minute results map to a pop-up dashboard that can sit on your desktop while you do whatever you're doing online tonight. It has at-a-glance results and also works on the iPhone. Another nice touch is a Wordle-esque feature that shows a cloud of words submitted by readers describing their feelings as the results unfold. Whether Obama wins or loses, that will be fascinating. It'll be linked from the homepage. There's also photo submissions, blogs and mobile news, on top of regular coverage.  • There's been a barrage of viral videos on the US election in the past 24 months and there's no let up yet. MoveOn is claiming that 15 million people have forwarded their 'shame on you' video and that is has been reaching 30 new people every second. It's what they describe as 'social nudging', discreet but sophisticated peer pressure to get people out to vote. Let's just hope the voting booths stay open long enough to register them all...  • There's also a whole Guardian world of election coverage on our US Elections 08 section: interactive charts, picture galleries, and you can even follow our US elections coverage bus across the US.   </body>

        <body> Silicon Valley has been 'Coming' to Oxford for eight years now. It's a simple premise and a relatively small crowd, but with a powerful combination of ambitious and talented MBAs and entrepreneurs and a slice of experienced, high-profile Silicon Valleyers.  First topic on the agenda this year? The economic crisis.  • How long will the economy stay tough for entrepreneurs? The panel between 18 months and ten years, but the consensus was 2 years. Twitter co-founder Biz Stone echoed that. He said the team had "sensed something looming" and managed to secure a large amount of funding just before the markets started to dive. "When lots of startups are retreating and thinking smaller, we are able to hire and grow aggressively in the next six months, both our service and our team. Now that we've got control of our reliability and performance issues we can look at our sustainability as a company. There's a lot of talent coming to us."  • Pat House, co-founder of Siebel Systems, said this period will mean companies can't become bloated by profitless services. "There is nothing more focusing than a lack of money," she said. "There couldn't be a better time - you cannot build irrelevant businesses in this climate. Keep your eyes on the prize - you won't be able to afford to do anything else."  Her survival strategy? Align yourself with the smartest people you know.  • Index Ventures partner and staple of the European startup Saul Klein emphasised that isn't isn't all about finding funding. "The best place to get money is from customers," he said. "If you're building a product that customers want, they will pay you money, And if you're not, you have to ask yourself why not. If they are using it in abundance, but you haven't figured out the business model yet, then that's fine too." He pointed to Twitter - they are building something that is becoming "essential to poeple's lives".  Klein also said that developing an international focus will be a huge advantage once we "emerge from the other end of the tunnel". "I genuinely believe it is not in the current DNA of US entrepreneurs to believe that the web is entirely global," he said.  "When we emerge... the world will look even more global than it does today. Markets we think are not monetisable today - Latin America and Asia - will be monetisable at other side of the tunnel. There's a massive opportunity to unseat the incumbents," he said, saying the best known web firms tends to be very US-centric.   </body>

        <body> The Guardian asked Twitter co-founder Evan Williams to speak at an event recently and he turned us down. And now we know why.  On top of all having to deal with Twitter constantly falling over under the weight of its own popularity, Williams has been busy with the acquisition of Summize, the Twitter search engine, he confirmed last night.  Officially, there's no comment on price, though Biz Stone's post on the official Twitter blog does come with some charming illustrations of a) Jack Dorsey signing the deal b) a sketch of what the combined Summize search will look like in Twitter and c) some pretty birdies.    "There is an undeniable need to search, filter, and otherwise interact with the volumes of news and information being transmitted to Twitter every second. We will be adding search and its related features to the core offering of Twitter in the very near future. In the meantime, everyone is welcome to access search.twitter.com--there's no need for a Twitter account."  Summize has six staff: five engineers will join Twitter and founder Jay Virdy will leave to do his own thing. The Summize domain already diverts to search.twitter.com.  So how much was the deal worth? Silicon Alley Insider reckons $15m, a combination of cash and stock. Om Malik's sources say the deal is a little over $8m (Either way, it's interesting to think of that valuation in the context of the paidContent deal, which was rumoured to be worth $30m.)  Why pay so much? As Kafka says on SIA, "Think of that development as a Rorschach test for your take on Web 2.0 in general: Either this thing is going to implode very soon, or people who get hung up on startup valuations are short-sighted bores who don't get the possiblities of technology."  But the real excitement is around how Summize will help Twitter monetise its audience, just as Google made its fortune with ads next to contextual searches.  "Summize has come up with a clever way of peering through Twitter's vast data stream and finding out what's hot, where and how," Malik had written.  "The results are essentially keywords - topic-, person- or location-based - and thus can be used to show contextual advertising next to the pages that show these results. Summize has thereby developed an ability to monetize conversations without being intrusive."  TechCrunch has a weighty video interview with Ev Wlliams, for more detail...

        <body> Three months after dropping SMS support in the UK citing prohibitive operator charges, Twitter has done the same to users in Canada.  Twitter's blog said last night that "unexpected billing changes" have forced it to stop delivering messages directly to users' mobiles because costs have been doubling for several months. That echoes its position in August, when it claimed that European charges meant support for outbound SMS was costing it $1,000 annually per user.  Photograph: [177]/Flickr/Some rights reserved  As in the UK, users in Canada will still be able to send messages via mobile but won't receive them. In the UK, a flurry of services sprang (Tweeteroo, 3Jam, TweetSMS, Zygo Tweet, TwitSMS) up offering to fill that gap with various levels of paid-for service, but users have been reluctant to start paying to solve an issue that Twitter has said it would like to resolve.  Co-founder Biz Stone told us on Monday that the company is recruiting ten new staff, some of whom will be mobile business development wizards that, they are hoping, will magic up some new deal that will enable Twitter to offer full SMS functionality again.  "It's not something we can flip a switch on," he said. "It needs a lot of deliberation and business development, but we're hiring aggressively for ten new positions including business development as hopefully these new people will really get on the front lines of mobile and negotiate so we can get the full, true spirit of Twitter working again.  He also said Twitter wanted this to be something it negotiated in-house, rather than relying on third-party solutions as Twitter for so much other functionality.   </body>

        <body> So Twitter denied that there are ads on the system.  Biz Stone told Silicon Alley Insider: "We're not putting ads on Twitter.com. As far as I can tell, a customied background image had some folks confused and speculating."  White Evan Williams had a brief Twitter exchange with Mike Arrington of TechCrunch in which he said the headline 'Twitter testing advertising in Twitter streams' was wrong and that it lacked any evidence.   Photo by Victoria Peckham on Flickr. Some rights reserved.  Curiously though, Valleywag dug out a post by Charlie O'Donnell from Path 101 from October last year where he spotted what seem to be trial os text ads on mobile Tweets. A screen grab shows a standard message followed by 'Tip: Wow, you look *good*' - the idea being that that could easily feature any succinct marketing message.  Think of that being contextual, and things get interesting.  "The new tracking feature will probably be used to help power ads, too... and what a powerful ad system that would be...
