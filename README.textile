* Unfinished app
* Some crashes
* Stores content in SQLite database but doesn't do anything with that store
* Doesn't iterate over all tags or articles using pagination options of the API
* Custom UI cells are the slow-scrolling kind made up of subviews rather than fast-rendered custom views

h2. Libraries used

* Everything in http://www.hackdiary.com/2009/01/26/switching-from-scripting-languages-to-objective-c-and-iphone-useful-libraries/
